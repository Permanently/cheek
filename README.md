# What??

**cheek** is similar to my other project, [ass](https://github.com/tycrek/ass). The biggest difference is that cheek is runs on Cloudflare's **serverless platform**, where ass uses traditional hosting with Node.js.

# Roadmap

- [x] Upload (supports ShareX currently)
- [x] Fetch/view image
- [ ] Delete image
- [ ] Embed features for Discord
- [ ] Multi-user

## These docs are a work-in-progress
